# Emotion-Recognition-and-Emoji-Recommendation using machine learning and neural networks 
In this project, we focus on a novel task named emoji recommendation in twitter-like
chat systems. We utilise hierarchical long short-term memory networks to encode the
contextual information located in conversations, and then give the appropriate
predictions according to the learned dialogue representations. Experimental results and
further discussions indicate that our method is capable of modelling contextual
information for emoji classification.
